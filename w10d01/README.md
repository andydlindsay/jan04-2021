### To Do

### Convo
* Entertaining jumping into something part way through
* Mimic how other things are written
* How to learn a new language
* Wasn't a fan of how Compass laid it out
* Triggered burnout
* Confidence in learning abilities
* Possibly a break after midterms
* React/Rails swapped?
* Move the CS workshop outside of mentor hours (even not Friday, or possibly earlier in the day)
* Why are we learning something that's obsolete?
* Would have preferred python
* More technical interviews
* How come we don't touch CSS more?
